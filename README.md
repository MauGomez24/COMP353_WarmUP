# COMP353_WarmUP

## Branches
Please make sure your branch is created from the main branch. Furthermore, branch names should start with the prefix `<type>/`, where `type`  
is one of the categories defined in the [Commit Message](#commit-message) section.  

## Naming conventions
- Column names for SQL tables should use `snake_case` for better readability
- MySQL is case-insensitive by default so table names should also use `snake_case`

## Code
- SQL keywords should be capitalized for better readability (ex: `SELECT`, `FROM`, etc)

## Pull Requests
- A pull request is required when merging into `main` from another branch.
- A minimum of 2 approvals (not counting the person creating the pull request) are needed to merge onto the main branch.

## Commit Message:
Please make sure all of your commit messages start with one the types defined below:
- `feat` : A new feature
- `fix` : A bug fix
- `docs` : Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (i.e. white-space, formatting, missing-semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor` : A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` : A code change that improves perfomance
- `revert` : Reverts a previous commit
